module in action at https://tinesoft.github.io/ngx-cookieconsent\nDependencies\n\nAngular (requires Angular 6+, v1.1.0 is the latest version for Angular \nCookie Consent (requires Cookie Consent 3 or higher, tested with 3.1.0)\n\nInstallation\nInstall above dependencies via npm. In particular for Cookie Consent:\nnpm install --save cookieconsentNow install ngx-cookieconsent via:\nnpm install --save ngx-cookieconsent\nAngular-CLI\n\nNote: If you are using angular-cli to build your app, make sure that cookieconsent is properly listed as a global library, and as global style.\n\nTo do so, edit your angular-cli.json as such:\n      \"scripts\": [\n        \"../node_modules/cookieconsent/build/cookieconsent.min.js\"\n      ],\n\n      \"styles\": [\n        \"../node_modules/cookieconsent/build/cookieconsent.min.css\"\n      ],\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for ngx-cookieconsent:\nmap: {\n  'ngx-cookieconsent': 'node_modules/ngx-cookieconsent/bundles/ngx-cookieconsent.umd.js',\n}In your systemjs config file, meta needs to tell the System loader how to load cookieconsent:\n    meta: {\n    './node_modules/cookieconsent/build/cookieconsent.min.js': {\n            format: 'amd'\n        }\n    }In your index.html file, add script and link tags to load  cookieconsent globally:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport {NgcCookieConsentModule} from 'ngx-cookieconsent';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice NgcCookieConsentModule.forRoot()):\nimport {NgcCookieConsentModule, NgcCookieConsentConfig} from 'ngx-cookieconsent';\n\nconst cookieConfig:NgcCookieConsentConfig = {\n  cookie: {\n    domain: 'localhost' // or 'your.domain.com' // it is mandatory to set a domain, for cookies to work properly (see https://goo.gl/S2Hy2A)\n  },\n  palette: {\n    popup: {\n      background: '#000'\n    },\n    button: {\n      background: '#f1d600'\n    }\n  },\n  theme: 'edgeless',\n  type: 'opt-out'\n};\n\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgcCookieConsentModule.forRoot(cookieConfig), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import NgcCookieConsentModule:\nimport {NgcCookieConsentModule} from 'ngx-cookieconsent';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgcCookieConsentModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}Usage\nOnce the module is imported, you can use the NgcCookieContentService in your component (i.e. AppComponent) to subscribe to main events fired by Cookie Consent and do stuff like disabling cookies or other.\nHere is how it works:\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgcCookieConsentService } from 'ngx-cookieconsent';\nimport { Subscription }   from 'rxjs/Subscription';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n  //keep refs to subscriptions to be able to unsubscribe later\n  private popupOpenSubscription: Subscription;\n  private popupCloseSubscription: Subscription;\n  private initializeSubscription: Subscription;\n  private statusChangeSubscription: Subscription;\n  private revokeChoiceSubscription: Subscription;\n  private noCookieLawSubscription: Subscription;\n\n  constructor(private ccService: NgcCookieConsentService){}\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // subscribe to cookieconsent observables to react to main events\n    this.popupOpenSubscription = this.ccService.popupOpen$.subscribe(\n      () => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n\n    this.popupCloseSubscription = this.ccService.popupClose$.subscribe(\n      () => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n\n    this.initializeSubscription = this.ccService.initialize$.subscribe(\n      (event: NgcInitializeEvent) => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n\n    this.statusChangeSubscription = this.ccService.statusChange$.subscribe(\n      (event: NgcStatusChangeEvent) => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n\n    this.revokeChoiceSubscription = this.ccService.revokeChoice$.subscribe(\n      () => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n\n      this.noCookieLawSubscription = this.ccService.noCookieLaw$.subscribe(\n      (event: NgcNoCookieLawEvent) => {\n        // you can use this.ccService.getConfig() to do stuff...\n      });\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    // unsubscribe to cookieconsent observables to prevent memory leaks\n    this.popupOpenSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.popupCloseSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.initializeSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.statusChangeSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.revokeChoiceSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.noCookieLawSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\nSee Cookie Consent Documentation to see more about how to customize the UI or interact with user interactions.\nI18n Support\nMessages displayed in the Cookie Consent Bar can easily be translated, using libraries like ngx-translate.\nBasically this involved the following steps (using ngx-translate + Anglar CLI):\n\nInstall and configure ngx-translate\n\nProvide the translation JSON files in src/assets/, for e.g: en.json, fr.json, ...\n\n\n{\n    \"cookie\": {\n        \"header\": \"Cookies used on the website!\",\n        \"message\": \"This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.\",\n        \"dismiss\": \"Got it!\",\n        \"allow\": \"Allow cookies\",\n        \"deny\": \"Decline\",\n        \"link\": \"Learn more\",\n        \"policy\": \"Cookie Policy\"\n    }\n}\nNote: see content-options.ts for complete list of messages that can be translated.\n\n\nConfigure your main component AppComponent\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private ccService: NgcCookieConsentService, private translateService:TranslateService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // Support for translated cookies messages\n    this.translateService.addLangs(['en', 'fr']);\n    this.translateService.setDefaultLang('en');\n\n    const browserLang = this.translateService.getBrowserLang();\n    this.translateService.use(browserLang.match(/en|fr/) ? browserLang : 'en');\n\n    this.translateService//\n      .get(['cookie.header', 'cookie.message', 'cookie.dismiss', 'cookie.allow', 'cookie.deny', 'cookie.link', 'cookie.policy'])\n      .subscribe(data => {\n\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content = this.ccService.getConfig().content || {} ;\n        // Override default messages with the translated ones\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.header = data['cookie.header'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.message = data['cookie.message'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.dismiss = data['cookie.dismiss'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.allow = data['cookie.allow'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.deny = data['cookie.deny'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.link = data['cookie.link'];\n        this.ccService.getConfig().content.policy = data['cookie.policy'];\n\n        this.ccService.destroy();//remove previous cookie bar (with default messages)\n        this.ccService.init(this.ccService.getConfig()); // update config with translated messages\n      });\n  }Credits\nngx-cookieconsent is built upon Cookie Consent, created by Insites\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2018 Tine Kondo.
